# Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application

This project demonstrates a simple tic-tac-toe web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to play against each other, taking turns to place their markers on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their markers in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players can take turns placing their markers (X or O) on the board by clicking on the grid cells.
- **Winning Conditions**: The application checks for winning conditions after each move to determine if a player has won the game.
- **Draw Detection**: The game detects if there is a draw when all cells on the board are filled and no player has won.
- **Reset Option**: Users can reset the game to start a new match.
